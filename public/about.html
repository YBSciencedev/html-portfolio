<hr />
<p>Junior QA Tester, I have experience working with JIRA, SQL/Oracle, API Postman, Kanban Board, and Scrum Agil Methodologies.</p>

<p>Due to my scientific background, I've developed critical thinking, attention to detail & problem-resolution skills. Excelling at my job allowed me to oversee higher-end decisions, and gave me the opportunity to work in an administrative position, as a QA tester, in the same company.</p>

<p>I've been working from home with a multicultural team, I'm passionate about learning everything tech related and beyond.</p>
